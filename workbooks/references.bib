	note = {This paper presents the first habitat suitability model of California overwintering monarch habitat. It is constrained to Santa Barbara County only, which is a weakness of the paper, but does a convincing job of establishing that there are a predictable set of climatic parameters that explain the distribution of overwintering groves. This paper supports Saniee and Villablanca's hypothesis that habitat is selected at multiple scales. It also has some concerning future predictions,where all current sites will be abandoned by 2050. I'm not so sure about that, as their model did not include isothermality, which I suspect is important to monarchs.},
