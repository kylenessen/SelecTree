    "text": "Sunset climate zones\nWhen I offered to scrape the Sunset Climate Zones, I didn’t realize that the information was only in The New Western Garden Book. That obviously complicates my scraping plans, but I have a few ideas.\n\nManually enter missing zones\nThis is the most direct way to get to the primary source for our missing trees. Fortunately, there are only 71 missing species, so I think this is the way to go. Below I list the first ten species with missing Sunset Zones as an example. I’ve also included a link to the SelecTree page.\n\n\n\nSpecies with Missing Sunset Zones (first 10)\n\n\nTree ID\nScientific Name\nSelecTree URL\n\n\n\n\n1829\nAextoxicon punctatum\nhttps://selectree.calpoly.edu/tree-detail/1829\n\n\n1831\nAristotelia chilensis\nhttps://selectree.calpoly.edu/tree-detail/1831\n\n\n1832\nAustrocedrus chilensis\nhttps://selectree.calpoly.edu/tree-detail/1832\n\n\n1860\nBeilschmiedia berteroana\nhttps://selectree.calpoly.edu/tree-detail/1860\n\n\n1833\nBeilschmiedia miersii\nhttps://selectree.calpoly.edu/tree-detail/1833\n\n\n1984\nBeilschmiedia tarairi\nhttps://selectree.calpoly.edu/tree-detail/1984\n\n\n1986\nCeratopetalum gummiferum\nhttps://selectree.calpoly.edu/tree-detail/1986\n\n\n1989\nDacrycarpus dacrydioides\nhttps://selectree.calpoly.edu/tree-detail/1989\n\n\n1990\nDacrydium cupressinum\nhttps://selectree.calpoly.edu/tree-detail/1990\n\n\n1836\nDasyphyllum diacanthoides\nhttps://selectree.calpoly.edu/tree-detail/1836\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Sheets\nI’ve prepared a Google Sheet to help with data entry. It contains all the species with missing sunset zones, as well as a column for each zone. It should be fairly straightforward to enter the information, simply check the box for each applicable zone. The “completed” column is there to indicate of that species is done.\n\n    SelecTree - Missing Sunset Climate Zones\n\n\n\n\nScrape other sites\nIf, for some reason, we want to rebuild the Sunset Zone information for this database, there are a number of sites that contain the information. We would likely need to piece together several sites to cover the whole SelecTree dataset. I’ve listed a few below.\n\nhttps://www.gardenia.net/\nhttps://calscape.org/\nhttps://pfaf.org/\nhttps://davesgarden.com/\n\nPlease note, however, that each site would represent its own coding endeavor, multiplying the work for each site added. I don’t think we should go down this path unless it’s warranted, but I wanted to make the option explicit here.\n\n\nReinvent a better wheel\nLooking into the Sunset Climate Zones has me wondering, “can we do this better?”\nFrom my understanding, the Sunset Zones take climatic characteristics relevant to plants, group them into a finite number of zones, and map them across the Western US.\nIt seems unlikely that Editors of Western Garden Book had access to millions of tree points and modern weather data when they wrote the original edition. No doubt, the book is a major accomplishment, but I wonder what could be done with a data driven approach with the information at our disposal.\nThis “better climate zones” project would no doubt take a lot of effort (maybe a master’s?), so I’m not suggesting we do this now. You have also probably already explored this idea and may be working on it now or there’s some complication I’m not aware of. Still, I think it’s worth bringing up, as such a product would make SelecTree stand out even more than it does now. We might be the only ones in the world right now who have the data to make it happen. For what it’s worth!"

I believe the correct name should be Brugmansia versicolor ‘Charles Grimaldi’.

For example, how would you find all trees that occur in sunset zone 5? You can’t simply search for “5” in the column, as zone 15 exists.\nA more practical way to address this type of information is to make a table entirely dedicated to sunset zones, where each zone gets a unique column. The value for each that column is simply true or false, accompanied by the species name or tree ID:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplayed_scientific_name\nzone_1\nzone_2\nzone_3\nzone_4\nzone_5\nzone_6\nzone_7\nzone_8\nzone_9\nzone_10\nzone_11\nzone_12\nzone_13\nzone_14\nzone_15\nzone_16\nzone_17\nzone_18\nzone_19\nzone_20\nzone_21\nzone_22\nzone_23\nzone_24\n\n\n\n\nAbies amabilis\nFALSE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\nAbies bracteata\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\nAbies concolor\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\n\n\nAbies concolor ‘Violacea’\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\n\n\nAbies firma\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\nAbies grandis\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nTRUE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\nFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis way you can simply filter by the zone you’re interested in.

At the very least, I can search for species that do not have this information.\nWe could meet with the data people to see if they have a table like this already, and if not, we could work with them to create one. Alternatively, I can make a tool for you to expand this table as needed.\n\n\n\nMany other columns fall into this table-compressed-to-a-column category. Essentially any column that contains (or can contain) multiple pieces of information within the same cell. Below I list the columns that I found which I believe should be expanded to separate tables:\n\n\n\nExpandable Columns\n\n\nattracts_wildlife\nfoliage_growth_color\npest_resistant\n\n\nbark_color\nfruit_value\npest_susceptibility\n\n\nbark_texture\nfruiting_time\nphotolocations\n\n\ndisease_resistant\nhealth_hazard\nsoil_texture\n\n\ndisease_susceptibility\nlandscape_application\nsunset_zone\n\n\nflower_color\nlandscape_use\ntree_shape\n\n\nflower_time\nlitter_type\nusda_zone\n\n\nfoliage_fall_color\nnative_range\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible Directions\n\n\n\nEach column presents a new effort for documenting tree characteristics.
