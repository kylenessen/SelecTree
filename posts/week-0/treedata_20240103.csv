It's the rarest and most unusual North American fir, growing slowly in rocky soils on the steep slopes of fog-laden ravines along Big Sur. These narrow, spire-like trees can grow over 100 feet tall, but most are much shorter. Compared to typical firs, their buds are much longer, their needles are much more sharply pointed, and their cones have long projections, giving the trees their other common name: bristlecone fir.

In Samoan legend, an eel asked his sweetheart to bury his head, from which grew the first niu tree– the eyes and mouth of the eel are visible on the husked nut of the coconut. In Tahitian myth, a man finds the first coconut trees growing from the heads of his starved children.  In Hawaiian legend, the coconut was brought to the islands as a gift from the god Kāne. Throughout the Pacific, mythologies which depict the coconut as a human embodiment are recurrent, symbolizing kinship and reciprocity with this critically important plant. Coconuts are economically important throughout the world; large-scale plantations in Pacific and Southeast Asian countries are main producers of coconut milk, copra, palm sugar, coconut oil. There is an incredible genetic diversity of coconut varieties and cultivars which have been developed under centuries human selection. Beyond its nutritional importance, niu is used in the Pacific to create cordage, thatch houses, woven into mats and baskets, and as spiritual offerings in traditional religious practices.  (E.

We do not recommend planting it in Hawai‘i. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; The lemon scented gum has an entirely smooth trunk that varies in color from powdery white to coppery pink and pale yellow. While older layers of thin bark are being shed, the trunk can become multicolored and mottled. When crushed, the bright green, narrow leaves smell of citronella and lemons, and an oil distilled from them is used in perfume manufacturing and as a mosquito repellent.

The lemon-scented essential oil is used in aromatherapy, perfumes, cosmetics, natural insect repellents, and herbal medicine. In Hawaiʻi, the Division of Forestry planted thousands of lemon-gum eucalyptus to prevent erosion and delineate property boundaries.

The god Krishna is associated with the &lt;i&gt;ashvattha&lt;/i&gt;, and believed to have died beneath its branches. &lt;i&gt;Ficus &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;religiosa&lt;/i&gt; has numerous medicinal uses; the bark is used to treat bacterial infections, the leaves are used in wound healing, the fruits have properties to treat diarrhea and asthma, and the latex is prepared to treat hemorrhages and inflammation. In Honolulu, the large Bodhi tree near the entrance of Foster Botanical Garden was planted by Sri Lankan monk Anagarika Dharmapala in 1913 as a gift to Mary Foster; the tree is a direct descendent from the &lt;i&gt;Jaya Sri &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maha&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Bodhi&lt;/i&gt;, the sacred tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment.

The hardwood is widely used for construction, musical instruments, furniture, and window frames. The sawdust can produce dermatitis due to toxins in the wood. There are reports of Aboriginal peoples drinking the flower nectar mixed with water for a sweet beverage. The species was introduced to Hawaiʻi from Australia in 1880 for reforestation efforts, but has since naturalized and become a serious weed in the island’s mesic and wet forests.

Throughout summer, toyon develops clusters of white flowers followed in the fall and early winter by pea-sized, bright red fruit. The genus name, Heteromeles, means different apple and describes these fruits, which are botanically similar to apples and pears, but far less tasty. In the past, entire limbs bearing these beautiful fruit were gathered from the wild and sold commercially for decorations at Christmas time (another common name is Christmas berry). Although there are no holly (Ilex spp.) native to the state, California folklore holds that the resemblance of toyon to hollies (with dark, evergreen, toothed leaves, and bright red fruit) may have influenced the naming of Hollywood, as toyon is abundant in the chaparral-covered hills above Los Angeles. The more likely origin of TinseltownÕs name is an 1880s subdivision in that area named after an Illinois estate called Hollywood. The species name, arbutifolia, refers to the similarity between the leaves of toyon and the leaves of members of the genus Arbutus","",0,"Carmel, CA, San Luis Obispo, CA, San Diego Botanical Gardens - Encinitas, CA and Los Angeles County Arboretum - Arcadia, CA",1,"Screen",,"California",1,0,0,"",15,25,8,15,12,24,"0","Rounded,Vase","Wet Fruit","Dark Brown, Dark Gray or Light Gray","Smooth","3","3","Simple","Alternate","Oblong","Dark Green",0,"Small","Red","Berry","Wildlife use it","Fall,Winter","Showy",0,"White","Summer",,"9,10,11","5,6,7,8,9,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24",,"4 to 7","Loam,Sand,Clay","Moderate",2,3,1,5,,"Scales,Thrip",,"Sudden Oak Death,Armillaria,Root Rot","Low","None Known","Bees,Birds","Low",,"L",0,"Yes","24"" box","1"

Mangos are grown ubiquitously in Hawai‘i and have become naturalized in windward low elevation areas. Many cultivars (&amp;lsquo;Haden  being the most popular) have been introduced into the Islands since the species was initially brought in the early 1800s. Trees produce best in hotter, drier leeward areas, but during extended dry periods require some irrigation to thrive. The sap from broken leaves may cause a contact dermatitis (like poison ivy and poison oak).&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Mangifera&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;indica&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;has a&amp;nbsp;HPWRA (Hawai‘i Pacific Weed Risk Assessment) score of 1&amp;nbsp;(Evaluate), and the Plant Pono link is:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plantpono.org/pono-plants/mangifera-indica/&quot;&gt;https://plantpono.org/pono-plants/mangifera-indica/&lt;/a&gt;.","One of the most celebrated and beloved tropical fruits, mangos are important worldwide in culinary traditions, folk medicine, and economic production. Mangos were domesticated as early as 2000 BC by peoples in the Indian subcontinent. The mango tree is sacred and religiously important in India and Southeast Asia; they are planted and cared for in sacred groves, referenced in religious texts, and used in ritual adornment during ceremonies. The excellent fruit can be eaten fresh and raw, made into jams, dried fruit, chutney, candy, juices, sweets, or cooked into savory dishes and curries. In Ayurveda traditional medicine, all parts of the trees have been used to treat disease and injury. Approximately 55 million tons of mango fruit were produced worldwide in 2020, indicating the economic importance of this crop to many tropical countries. Many hundreds of mango cultivars have been developed for variation in fruit qualities and cultivation success in different climates. The wood is used in house construction, bowl making, flooring, furniture, and the creation of musical instruments. Mango trees were introduced to Hawaii in 1825, and now grow abundantly throughout the Honolulu urban area, neighborhoods, and have naturalized in the lowland forest (Mukherjee, 1972; Rai et al., 2007)",1,"Hilo and Kona, HI, LA County Arboretum - Arcadia, CA, San Diego, CA, Qail Botanical Gardens - Encinitas, CA and Chapala, Mexico",1,"Shade Tree,Screen","Hedged","India",0,0,0,"",50,50,30,30,24,36,"0","Rounded","Leaves,Fruit","Brown","Blocky",,,"Simple","Alternate","Oblong","Green",0,"Very Large","Green, Yellow or Red","Drupe","Edible,Wildlife use it","Spring,Summer","Showy",0,"White","Winter,Spring",,"11,12","23,24,H1,H2",,">7","Loam,Sand,Clay","",3,3,2,6,,"Scales",,"Anthracnose,Sooty Mold","Low",,"Bees,Birds","",,"H",0,"Yes","24"" box","—"

This species, along with Monterey and Bishop pines, has thick woody seed cones whose scales stay sealed with pitch, only releasing their seeds after the high temperatures of a fire. Most stands are even-aged, with individuals all having germinated after the fire that killed the previous generation; they often grow in dense thickets.

It's similar to ponderosa pine (&lt;em&gt;Pinus ponderosa&lt;/em&gt;). Both are three-needle pines that often dominate California's montane forests. Jeffrey pine tolerates extreme conditions and grows in dry, exposed habitats, including on serpentine soil, throughout much of the state. Its bark releases a sweet odor of vanilla and butterscotch. Jeffrey pine needles have a duller green color than ponderosa pine, and its cones are larger with a recurved prickle on the tip of each cone scale.

Away from its California home, it is one of the world's most important plantation timber trees, having been extensively planted in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is often weedy. Monterey pine has gray bark, dark green needles, usually in clusters of three, and knobby light brown, lopsided cones that persist on the trunk and branches.

Outside their narrow native range, these trees thrive in cultivation and have naturalized in several areas along California's Central Coast, including northwestern Santa Barbara County, coastal San Luis Obispo County, and along Monterey Bay in the town of Marina. Torrey pines grow slowly into picturesque broad-canopied trees. They are the only five-needle pines in California with long needles.

It was separated from &lt;em&gt;Podocarpus&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, mainly based on the absence of a fleshy receptacle at the base of the seed cone, and stomata on both sides of the leaves vs. only on the underside (abaxial surface) in &lt;em&gt;Podocarpus&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the basis of more slender leaves and a more oval, egg-shaped seed &lt;em&gt;Afrocarpus gracilior&lt;/em&gt; (Pilg.) C.N.Page from higher elevation wet forests of Kenya and Ethiopia is sometimes kept separate from Afrocarpus falcatus, which would then be considered to be restricted to southern Africa (Southern Cape). In my research of the literature, I realized that as far back as 1935 (Robyns, Bull. Inst. Roy. Colon. Belge, 6, 237, 1935) some experts have considered that all &lt;em&gt;Afrocarpus&lt;/em&gt; (at that time called small leaved African podocarps) are so closely related with overlapping, intergrading characters, that all four species can arguably be treated as geographical varieties of a single species.  If you take this view, which many South African taxonomist do, then all species should be called &lt;em&gt;A. falcatus&lt;/em&gt;, which was named first and takes precedence.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the material we have in California (that I have seen) has the characteristics of &lt;em&gt;A. falcatus&lt;/em&gt;, sensu strictu. The seeds that I've seen on this species in California are nearly spherical (&lt;em&gt;A. falcatus&lt;/em&gt; sensu strictu) and not oval or elongate (&lt;em&gt;A. gracilior&lt;/em&gt; sensu strictu). The seed surfaces of the California material are rough (verrucose) and the leaves tend to be smaller than any written description of &lt;em&gt;A. gracilior&lt;/em&gt; sensu strictu.&lt;/span&gt;
","In Ethiopia, this species has deep religious significance; it is an indispensable canopy component of natural sacred forests, an element of ancestral tree-based ritual and ceremony, and planted as totemic trees in front of households. Throughout its native distribution in Africa, the bark of &lt;i&gt;A. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;falcatus&lt;/i&gt; is used in traditional magic practices, and the wood is used for boat construction.

In many areas valley oaks have been unsuccessful in reproduction for years; as old trees die, there are no young trees to replace them.","",0,"Tilden Regional Parks Botanical Garden - Berkeley, CA, San Luis Obispo, CA, Los Gatos, CA, Visalia, CA, Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden - Claremont, CA, Los Angeles County Arboretum - Arcadia, CA and Albuquerque BioPark - Rio Grande Botanic Garden",1,"Riparian",,"California",1,0,0,"",50,70,50,50,24,36,"0","Rounded","Dry Fruit","Dark Brown, Light Gray or Light Green","Blocky,Furrowed","3","4","Simple","Alternate","Obovate","Green",1,"Medium","Brown","Acorn",,"Fall,Winter","Inconspicuous",0,,"Spring",,"7,8,9","3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,24","Moderate Inland",">7","Loam,Sand","Low",2,3,3,7,,"Invasive Shot Hole Borer,Beetle Borers,Caterpillars,Insect Galls","Verticillium","Armillaria,Crown Rot,Mistletoe,Root Rot","Moderate","Allergy,Poisonous","Birds,Squirrels","Moderate",,"M",1,"Yes","24"" box","3"

Its leaves are typically dark green and have a glossy texture, resembling those of holly, which adds to its visual appeal. During its flowering season, it produces small, inconspicuous blossoms, typically greenish in color. These flowers are essential for its reproductive process and provide a modest source of nectar for pollinators. The plant's fruits, however, are more prominent, featuring small, round berries that turn red when mature. These berries serve as a food source for local wildlife.

These fast-growing, deciduous shrubs or small trees are abundant along streams and have leaves with glossy, bright green tops and dull, pale undersides. The inconspicuous flowers appear in elongated clusters in winter before the new leaves emerge. Seed-forming female flowers and pollen-producing male flowers develop on separate plants. During the late spring, after pollination, the female flower clusters become a fuzzy mass of hairy seeds, which are light and easily carried great distances by flowing water and wind. Native Americans had many uses for this treeÕs pliable shoots, such as basketry and shelter construction. The bark, which was used for making rope, contains salicylic acid, the precursor to aspirin. Salix is the Latin name for a willow, and lasiolepis means woolly scale, referring to the scale-like leaves that protect the dormant buds.","",0,"Santa Barbara Botanic Garden - Santa Barbara, CA, Quail Arboretum - Encinitas, CA and Regional Parks Botanic Garden, Tilden Regional Park - Berkeley, CA",1,"Riparian,Screen",,"California and Southwestern United States",1,0,0,"",10,40,,,36,36,"1","Rounded","Dry Fruit","Dark Brown or Dark Gray","Furrowed,Smooth","1","1","Simple","Alternate","Oblanceolate","Green",1,"Very Small","Brown","Capsule",,"Summer","Inconspicuous",0,,"Winter,Spring","Has either male or female reproductive parts (dioecious)",,"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,14,15,16,17,22,23,24",,"4 to 7","Loam,Sand,Clay","Moderate",2,3,1,7,,"Invasive Shot Hole Borer,Aphids,Beetle Borers,Caterpillars","Verticillium","Anthracnose,Willow Blight,Armillaria,Phytophthora","High","Allergy",,"High",,"H",0,,,

It may be considered a small tree, except that it rarely has only a single trunk, a feature that many botanists use to help define the unclear distinction between shrubs and trees. Blue elderberry grows throughout western North America along streams and also in drier habitats such as coastal scrub, chaparral, and forest openings. Its compound, oppositely arranged leaves are divided into three to nine toothed leaflets. In spring, it produces flat-topped clusters of many cream-colored flowers. These are followed by bunches of dark blue, wax-covered berries. The fruit, which are attractive to birds, can be used for making pie, jelly, and wine. Cooked leaves and roots, as well as decoctions of the flowers, were used medicinally as external compresses to relieve soreness and inflammation. All parts of this plant are poisonous except the flowers and berries. Native Americans removed the spongy internal pith of new stems to make whistles, flutes, and other musical instruments. Coincidentally, Carolus Linnaeus named the genus Sambucus after a Greek musical instrument called the sambuca, made from the wood of a related species. Nigra means black. Caerulea, which means dark blue, is the only subspecies that occurs in California. It is part of a larger species complex native to most of North America and Europe.","",0,"Albuquerque BioPark - Rio Grande Botanic Garden and Hoyt Arboretum - Portland, OR",1,"Riparian,Screen",,"Western North America",1,0,0,"",10,20,10,20,36,36,"0","Rounded","Wet Fruit"," Dark Gray or Light Gray","Fissured","1","1","Pinnately Compound","Opposite","Ovate","Light Green",1,"Small","Black or Mostly Blue","Berry","Edible","Summer","Showy",0,"White","Summer",,"10","1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24",,"2 to 4","Sand","Low",2,3,1,4,,"Beetle Borers","Texas Root Rot","Verticillium","Low","Allergy","Birds","",,"M",0,,,

They grow just as fast when theyÕre 2,500 years old as when theyÕre 250 years old. Their spongy, fire-resistant, rust-colored bark can be up to three feet thick. Green, egg-sized cones can remain on the trees for many years, growing as they age. For a century, beginning around 1850, trees were logged for grape stakes, fence posts, and shingles for towns and farms of the Central Valley. Most of the remaining groves are protected within national forests or national and state parks, though many trees have been lost recently to severe fires and drought.","",0,"Stanford, CA, Cal Poly State University - San Luis Obispo, CA, Tilden Regional Parks Botanic Garden - Berkeley, CA, UC Santa Cruz Arboretum - Santa Cruz, CA, Strybing Arboretum - San Francisco, CA, Sierra National Park, CA, Hoyt Arboretum - Portland, OR, and New Zealand",1,,,"California",1,0,0,"",50,200,30,50,36,36,"3","Conical","Dry Fruit","Red Brown","Fissured","5","5","Simple","Alternate","Scale-like","Bluish Green,Silver,Gray Green",0,"Small to Medium","Brown or Red","Cone",,"Fall,Winter","Inconspicuous",0,,,,"6,7,8,9","1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23",,">7","Loam,Sand,Clay","Moderate",3,3,3,5,,"Carpenter Ant",,"Annosus Root Disease,Armillaria,Phytophthora Root Rot","High","None Known","Birds,Squirrels","Moderate",,"H",0,"Yes","24"" box","4"

Tamarind is used in traditional medicine by local people across its global naturalized range; among a multitude of applications, it is used to treat wounds, fever, respiratory problems, malaria, and venereal disease. The sweet distinctive taste of tamarind seed pulp is a favorite ingredient in juices, jams, chutney, curries, sweet meats, and sherbet. The leaves are also used to spice savory dishes, soups, and stews. The timber of &lt;i&gt;T. indica&lt;/i&gt; is suitable for woodworking, and used to make canoes, furniture, tools, and structures.

It is commonly planted along Pacific beaches to protect atolls and coasts from erosion associated with high tides and storm surge; the species has been recently promoted as a climate change adaptation strategy for island communities. Used commonly in Samoa as a shade tree in people’s yards and gardens; the terminal shoots and lateral branches of the tree are sometimes weighted with rocks to train the tree into optimal shading architecture. As its common English name ‘tropical almond’ indicates, the soft endosperm is edible eaten throughout its range as a supplemental or famine food. The leaves and bark are prepared as an infusion Tonga to treat mouth infections, cure headaches, and heal bone fractures.

Its large leaves (pinnately compound, with 5 to 10 pairs of leaflets and a single terminal leaflet) are often borne in pairs (oppositely) on the stem, whereas the leaves of most other legumes arise individually (alternately). Also, its distinctive fruit is a highly modified bean pod with a flattened wing; it spins like a helicopter when falling from the tree. The rapidly growing tipu tree is planted throughout warmer parts of California. It is praised for its beauty, drought tolerance, and durability in varying soil conditions, but it is criticized for having invasive roots and brittle wood. The fallen remnants of its lovely, apricot orange to lemon yellow flowers carpet sidewalks during early summer.

Straight, tapering trunks covered in furrowed, grayish-brown bark support a canopy of dark green glossy leaves, each tipped with a sharp point. As in other members of the yew family (Taxaceae), the cones on female trees are fleshy. The California nutmeg's are yellowish-green with maroon stripes and are slightly larger than an olive.

Trees remain unbranched and columnar until they first flower, which can take thirty years, but they may develop a highly branched canopy in age. The largest exceed 40 feet in height and have massive trunks. Their clumsy-appearing, twisting branches are covered in sharply-pointed, bayonet-like leaves that eventually turn brown, forming a long-lasting thatch. The trunks of older trees have checkered, grayish-brown bark exposed after the leaves fall. As a keystone species of the Mojave Desert, Joshua trees support an abundance of wildlife that depend on them for food and shelter. Their reproduction and that of their sole pollinator, the yucca moth (Tegeticula synthetica), are wholly interdependent. Their large, cream-colored flowers go unpollinated if the moth is absent, and the moth must have yucca flowers to complete its life cycle.","",0,"Mohave Desert, CA, Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden - Claremont, CA and Tilden Regional Parks Botanic Garden - Berkeley, CA",1,"Screen",,"California and Southwestern United States",1,0,0,"",15,25,,,12,12,"3","Sword Palm","Dry Fruit,Flowers","Light Gray or Red Brown","Fissured","3","4","Simple","Alternate","Spear-shaped","Green",0,"Very Large","Brown, Red or Mostly Green","Capsule",,"Spring,Summer","Showy",0,"Green,White","Winter,Spring",,"6,7,8,9,10","8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24",,"4 to 7","Loam,Sand","Moderate",3,3,3,7,,,"Texas Root Rot",,"Low","None Known",,"",,"VL",1,"Yes","24"" box","—"

Its leaves are typically long, slender, and sword-like, creating an eye-catching and dramatic appearance. During its flowering season, it produces tall spikes adorned with small, cream-colored flowers, which, while not showy individually, create a striking visual effect when clustered together. These flowers are essential for pollination and contribute to local ecosystem dynamics. Yucca schidigera is also recognized for its unique association with yucca moths, which rely on the plant for their lifecycle. The plant's tough, fibrous leaves have traditional and practical uses among indigenous cultures, making it a culturally significant species in its native range.","",0,"Joshua Tree, CA and Santa Barbara Botanic Garden - Santa Barbara, CA",1,"Screen",,"California and Southwestern United States",1,0,0,"",5,15,3,5,12,12,"3","Sword Palm","Dry Fruit,Flowers","Grayish Brown","Fissured","3","4","Simple","Alternate","Spear-shaped","Green",0,"Very Large","Brown, Red or Mostly Green","Capsule",,"Summer","Showy",0,"White","Spring","Has male and female reproductive parts in each flower (perfect)","9,10,11","7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,24",,"2 to 4","Loam,Sand","Moderate",3,3,3,7,,,"Texas Root Rot",,"Low","None Known","Birds,Butterflies","",,"VL",0,,,

Its wood was traditionally used for many applications, including musical instruments (ukuleles), surfboards, fishing hooks, and outrigger canoes. The young leaves are feathery and divided but quickly develop into single, curved, leathery simple leaves (called phyllodes). Many acacias, especially the species native to Australia and the Pacific Islands make leaves that mature into simple, undivided phyllodes. This is thought to be a drought adaptation. Koa is a large tree that can become nearly 100 feet tall in its native stands. &lt;em&gt;Acacia koa&lt;/em&gt; has no HPWRA (Hawai‘i Pacific Weed Risk Assessment) score, and the Plant Pono link is: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://plantpono.org/pono-plants/acacia-koa/&quot;&gt; https://plantpono.org/pono-plants/acacia-koa/&lt;/a&gt;","| Koa is endemic to Hawaiʻi, where it is a critical component of Hawaiian ecosystems, cultural traditions, and worldview.  In the Hawaiian language, ʻkoa’ also signifies strength, bravery, and fearlessness. The trunk of large koa were used to carve the hulls of Hawaiian &lt;em&gt;waʻa&lt;/em&gt; (oceangoing outrigger canoes); before felling the tree, offerings of fish, pig, and ‘&lt;em&gt;awa&lt;/em&gt; were given to ask permission of the gods. The wood of koa also bore religious significance, and was used to carve the staff of &lt;em&gt;kahili&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(feathered adornments associated with royalty), ‘&lt;em&gt;umeke&lt;/em&gt; (calabash containers), weaponry, and traditional surfboards. The sickle shaped phyllodes of koa are used to make lei. The beautifully colored wood of koa continues to be of cultural and commercial importance today; it is used to make ‘ukulele and other musical instruments, furniture, bowls, and wood carvings. Koa an increasingly important forestry species, planted for commercial and conservation goals alike across the islands. (Abbott, 1992; B.

Luscombe, recognising the potential of the species for cut foliage, collected commercial quantities of seed of the species from his property called ‘Moon Lagoon’, adjacent to Lake Chinocup Reserve just west of Pingrup. The property was partly named for its crescent-shaped saltpans and small salt lakes, but especially for a defining event in Luscombe’s life: “camping with my two young daughters and walking across one of the salt crystal lakes with about 1 cm of water in it, with moon and stars above and below, gave the impression of walking in space – they’ve never forgotten after 30 years” (Peter Luscombe, pers. comm.).&lt;/span&gt;
